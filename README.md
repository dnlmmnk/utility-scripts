# ðŸ§° Utility Scripts Dump

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a personal toolbox of small, functional scripts Iâ€™ve created for daily tasks â€” mostly for macOS, but many should work cross-platform. Some are useful, some are messy, most are somewhere in between.

Expect things like:
- ðŸŽž Batch MOV â†’ MP4 converter (with progress bar)
- ðŸ“‘ PDF metadata cleaner
- ðŸ”„ CSV to TXT converter
- âœ¨ ...and more as I build them

Currently, this is somewhat of a warehouse â€” scripts are all in one place, but Iâ€™ll eventually organize them into separate, themed repositories. For now, youâ€™re welcome to explore, copy, fork, or laugh at my code. ðŸ˜…

No warranties, no promises, just scripts. MIT licensed, take what you need.
